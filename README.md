Hello,

This is the README file for my submission to the Car Price Assignment. The python jupyter notebook for this assignment can be found here https://github.com/lalbritten01/LAlbri10_UCBerkelyAI/blob/UC_Berkeley-Car-Price_Assignment/Practical_Application_Assignment_11_1_What_Drives_the_Price_of_a_Car_.ipynb

The jupyter python notebook linked above has information from a dataset of car prices and attributes to determine what factors may affect car price. 

The Car data has much information on the characteristics of cars as well as their sale prices.

In the analysis of the data I found interesting insights concerning affect of mileage and car condition on car sale price.

Cars with more mileage tend to have less expensive sale prices than their lower mileage counterparts. Also the inclusion of the car condition variable in the car price linear regression greatly increases the accuracy of the regression.
In the linear regression with the car condition variable, the only condition with a positive effect is the excellent car condition, while all other car conditions (new, like new, fair, etc.) have a negative effect increasing in magnitude as the car condition gets nearer to poor condition.
