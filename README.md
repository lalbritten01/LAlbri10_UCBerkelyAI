Hello,

This is the README file for my submission to the Customer Coupon Acceptance assignment. The python jupyter notebook for this assignment can be found here 
https://github.com/lalbritten01/LAlbri10_UCBerkelyAI/blob/UC-Berkeley-Customer-Coupon-Assignment/CustomerCouponAcceptance_TreAlbritten.ipynb

The jupyter python notebook linked above has information from a dataset of customer participants in a coupon program as well as an analysis of certain characteristics of interest in understanding
customer likelihood to accept a coupon offer. 

The Customer coupon data has much information on the characteristics of different drivers who were offered coupons, as well as whether or not they accepted the coupon text offer.

In the analysis of the data I found interesting insights concerning the customers who were offered coupons to Bars as well as the customers who were offered coupons to Coffee Houses.

Customers who are typically interested in going to bars once a month or cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month are likely to be interested in accepting the coupons. 
The coupon acceptance rate for each of the three categories tested in the cell above show higher acceptance rates than the acceptance rate over all customers presented with an opportunity to accept a Bar coupon

Customers who go to Coffee Houses more than 4 times a month are likely to be interested in accepting the coupons. 
Of the customers who go to coffee houses more than 4 times a month, those customers riding Alone (without a passenger) were the most likely to be offered a coupon, 
while customers riding with a Friend were the most likely to accept a coupon.
Of the customers who go to coffee houses more than 4 times a month, it seems that income does not have a large effect on interest in accepting the coupon,
as customers in the lowest income group of less than $12500 were more likely to accept the coupon than customers in the highest income group of greater than $100000.
